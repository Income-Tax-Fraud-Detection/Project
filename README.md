A Secure Framework to Develop Income Tax Fraud Detection using AI &amp; ML

"THE SECURE FRAMEWORK TO DEVELOP INCOME TAX FRAUD DETECTION USING AI-ML TECHNIQUES" investigates the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to identify potential instances of income tax fraud. The escalating challenge of tax evasion necessitates the adoption of advanced technologies to enhance early detection and prevention mechanisms. The project delves into the development and evaluation of predictive models trained on diverse financial datasets, aiming to accurately assess reported income against actual income (predicted income).

Various supervised learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting, are employed to predict individuals' actual income based on reported financial information. Feature engineering techniques, including label encoding and standardization, are applied to optimize the models' performance.

The project encompasses exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and correlation analysis to ensure the dataset's quality. Model evaluations, utilizing standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared on a test set, provide valuable insights into the accuracy and reliability of the models.

The user interface for the Income Tax Fraud Detection system is implemented through Streamlit, allowing users to input various financial parameters for predictions. The project concludes with the identification of the best-performing model, which is subsequently deployed for real-time fraud detection.

This research contributes to fortifying financial systems against fraudulent activities by leveraging the capabilities of AI and ML. The findings offer significant insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of predictive analytics for income tax fraud detection.
